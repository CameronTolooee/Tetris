  *   Tetris wouldn't be very fun if it wasn't animated. 
  *   Radio buttons 'a', 'b', and 'c' under the music will change the background song
Anything needing explanation:
I've tried to make this as close to the original tetris as I could, the leveling and scoring 
are dynamic as you score more points. If you get to level 9 each subsequent piece will fall
twice as fast, meaning you pretty much lose. There's an animation when you lose and a screen
to play again. Don't waste too much time playing it!

Chrome running on Windows doesn't size the applet correctly, however, all other browsers seem to work.
